I'm an aspiring software engineer, language-nerd, and lover of geography (especially that of underrated, mid-sized American cities)

*Ejdelsztejn* is the Polish spelling of a portmanteau of my two family names, *Stein* and *Ejdelman*.  It also happens to mean "gemstone" in Yiddish, which is fitting for a lover of the Ruby programming language.
